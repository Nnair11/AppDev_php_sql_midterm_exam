<h1>Application Development Midterm Examination</h1>

<h2>Grocery Management System | Grocery Inventory Table</h2>

This project is a Grocery Management System built as part of the Application Development Midterm Examination, using PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin.
It demonstrates the creation, configuration, and management of a complete database-driven web application that handles grocery items, suppliers, and categories efficiently.


<h2>System Features</h2>

<h3>The Grocery Inventory System includes:</h3>
- A well-structured database schema with proper foreign key relationships.

- Category and supplier linking, allowing items to be grouped and sourced properly.

- Automatic timestamps for tracking when each product was added.

- A modern HTML interface that presents all grocery items clearly and neatly.

- Real-time data manipulation, ensuring that updates, deletions, and insertions are reflected immediately.

- Secure PDO-based queries to prevent SQL injection and improve reliability.

- In this examination we students should create a grocery items table & configure a schema & database in myphpadmin. 

- by using a simple php & html code it demonstrate how I answer each problem given using the PDO method.
  
<h3>Through this project, I learned how to:</h3>

- Design and normalize a database schema for a grocery inventory.

- Create and populate tables directly in phpMyAdmin using SQL commands.

- Connect PHP to MySQL securely using the PDO (PHP Data Objects) method.

- Perform essential database operations: fetching, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

- Display real-time data dynamically inside an HTML table using PHP and SQL queries.
  
<h3>Each PHP file in this system demonstrates a specific database concept:</h3>

1. SCHEMA + DATABASE RECORDS – Defines the structure of the database (Categories, Suppliers, and Grocery_Items) and inserts sample data.

2. dbconfig.php – Establishes a secure PDO database connection and handles connection errors gracefully.

3. FETCH_ALL() – Retrieves and displays multiple rows of data from a query.

4. FETCH() – Retrieves a single record from the database.

5. INSERTION – Demonstrates how new grocery items can be added to the database.

6. DELETION – Demonstrates how existing records can be safely removed.

7. UPDATING – Demonstrates how to modify an existing record.

8. HTML TABLE RENDERING – Displays grocery inventory data in a clean, styled, and responsive HTML
